  abstract = {To compare court decisions in a systematic way, it is typically necessary to first read these decisions and then apply legal methods to them. Measurement models that support analysts in this manual labor usually rely on judges’ voting records. Since these data are often not available, we instead propose a latent-variable model that uses the widely available references in court decisions to measure the decisions’ latent position in their common case-space. We showcase our model in the context of forum shopping and forum selling of Germany’s lower courts.},

  abstract = {Politicians and citizens increasingly engage in political conversations on social media outlets such as Twitter. In this article, I show that the structure of the social networks in which they are embedded can be a source of information about their ideological positions. Under the assumption that social networks are homophilic, I develop a Bayesian Spatial Following model that considers ideology as a latent variable, whose value can be inferred by examining which politics actors each user is following. This method allows us to estimate ideology for more actors than any existing alternative, at any point in time and across many polities. I apply this method to estimate ideal points for a large sample of both elite and mass public Twitter users in the United States and five European countries. The estimated positions of legislators and political parties replicate conventional measures of ideology. The method is also able to successfully classify individuals who state their political preferences publicly and a sample of users matched with their party registration records. To illustrate the potential contribution of these estimates, I examine the extent to which online behavior during the 2012 US presidential election campaign is clustered along ideological lines.},

  abstract = {Judicial documents and judgments are a rich source of information about legal cases, litigants, and judicial decision-makers. Natural language processing (NLP) based approaches have recently received much attention for their ability to decipher implicit information from text. NLP researchers have successfully developed data-driven representations of text using dense vectors that encode the relations between those objects. In this study, we explore the application of the Doc2Vec model to legal language to understand judicial reasoning and identify implicit patterns in judgments and judges. In an application to federal appellate courts, we show that these vectors encode information that distinguishes courts in time and legal topics. We use Doc2Vec document embeddings to study the patterns and train a classifier model to predict cases with a high chance of being appealed at the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS). There are no existing benchmarks, and we present the first results at this task at scale. Furthermore, we analyze generic writing/judgment patterns of prominent judges using deep learning-based autoencoder models. Overall, we observe that Doc2Vec document embeddings capture important legal information and are helpful in downstream tasks.},

We emphasize preferences over dispositions on the grounds of plausibility and tractability. We then identify desireable properties of dispositional utility functions and the relationship between dispositional utility and expected utility for rules. We examine the impact on expected rule utility from case distributions that are sensitive to the enforced rule. We illustrate how to combine dipositional utility with efforts costs and time constraints. We provide examples of case spaces, dispositional utility functions, and expected utility functions for enforced rules.},

Two paradigms have emerged: law-as-code, which seeks to represent legal rules in a logical, executable format; and law-as-data, which leverages quantitative analysis of legal texts to reveal patterns and insights. This article surveys these approaches, emphasizing recent developments in large language models and generative artificial intelligence (AI). Law-as-code systems have enabled applications from tax preparation software to smart contracts, but realizing the vision of fully computational law has proven challenging. Law-as-data techniques like natural language processing and machine learning have charted the semantic relationship between courts and illuminated changes in judicial culture. Generative models showcase AI's explosive progress, with impressive feats like passing the U.S. bar example, but they also highlight limitations like factual inaccuracy and interpretability issues. Hybrid approaches integrating computational law, data science, and AI offer a promising research direction. As these tools spread, legal scholars can analyze more legal data than ever before, but they must remain cognizant of challenges like biased or low-quality data and linguistic/cultural limitations. Used judiciously alongside traditional methods, computational analysis has the potential to revolutionize empirical legal studies.},

Using a difference-in-differences design, among federal courts of appeals judges we show that a judge’s alma mater’s participation in the National Collegiate Athletic Association Men’s Basketball Tournament both slows the rate at which opinions are drafted and ultimately undermines the opinions’ quality, even accounting for the additional time judges spend writing them. The findings suggest that incentives for leisure influence important normative concerns for swift and high-quality justice.},

We collect original datasets classifying citations from search and seizure and freedom of religion opinions written between 1953 and 2006 into these different types and develop a model relating the similarity of the doctrine embodied in the citing and cited opinions to the relative probability of these different types of citations. The resulting spatial estimates of opinion location are used to evaluate theories of Supreme Court bargaining and opinion writing. We find empirical support for theoretical models that predict the majority opinion will fall at the ideal point of the median member of the majority coalition. Given the centrality of theories of judicial policymaking to various substantive problems in political science, the method of scaling opinions developed in this article can facilitate a range of future research.},

This approach is extremely flexible, applicable to any legislative setting, irrespective of size, the extremism of the legislators' voting histories, or the number of roll calls available for analysis. The model is easily extended to let other sources of information inform the analysis of roll call data, such as the number and nature of the underlying dimensions, the presence of party whipping, the determinants of legislator preferences, and the evolution of the legislative agenda; this is especially helpful since generally it is inappropriate to use estimates of extant methods (usually generated under assumptions of sincere voting) to test models embodying alternate assumptions (e.g., log-rolling, party discipline). A Bayesian approach also provides a coherent framework for estimation and inference with roll call data that eludes extant methods; moreover, via Bayesian simulation methods, it is straightforward to generate uncertainty assessments or hypothesis tests concerning any auxiliary quantity of interest or to formally compare models. In a series of examples we show how our method is easily extended to accommodate theoretically interesting models of legislative behavior. Our goal is to provide a statistical framework for combining the measurement of legislative preferences with tests of models of legislative behavior.},

  abstract = {Vote-specific parameters are often by-products of roll call analysis, the primary goal being the measurement of legislators' ideal points. But these vote-specific parameters are more important in higher-dimensional settings: prior restrictions on vote parameters help identify the model, and researchers often have prior beliefs about the nature of the dimensions underlying the proposal space. Bayesian methods provide a straightforward and rigorous way for incorporating these prior beliefs into roll call analysis. I demonstrate this by exploiting the close connections among roll call analysis, item-response models, and “full-information” factor analysis. Vote-specific discrimination parameters are equivalent to factor loadings, and as in factor analysis, they (1) enable researchers to discern the substantive content of the recovered dimensions, (2) can be used for assessing dimensionality and model checking, and (3) are an obvious vehicle for introducing and testing researchers' prior beliefs about the dimensions. Bayesian simulation facilitates these uses of discrimination parameters, by simplifying estimation and inference for the massive number of parameters generated by roll call analysis.},

This doctrinal-politics approach highlights a relatively new formal apparatus known as the case-space model, and it invokes close ties between theoretical and empirical work and between the study of judicial behavior and actual legal practices and institutions. The case-space model is an adaption of standard policy-space modeling, tailored for the distinguishing features of judicial policy making. It allows for ideological differences between judges while expressing those differences in terms of legal rules that partition fact-filled legal cases into different dispositions.

First, the Court cites precedent based on the legal issues in the case, not the country of origin. Second, the Court is more careful to embed judgements in its existing case law when the expected value of persuading domestic judges is highest. These findings contribute to a developing literature that suggests international and domestic review courts develop their authority in similar ways.},

  abstract = {At the heart of attitudinal and strategic explanations of judicial behavior is the assumption that justices have policy preferences. In this paper we employ Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to fit a Bayesian measurement model of ideal points for all justices serving on the U.S. Supreme Court from 1953 through 1999. We are particularly interested in determining to what extent ideal points of justices change throughout their tenure on the Court. This is important because judicial politics scholars oftentimes invoke preference measures that are time invariant. To investigate preference change, we posit a dynamic item response model that allows ideal points to change systematically over time. Additionally, we introduce Bayesian methods for fitting multivariate dynamic linear models to political scientists. Our results suggest that many justices do not have temporally constant ideal points. Moreover, our ideal point estimates outperform existing measures and explain judicial behavior quite well across civil rights, civil liberties, economics, and federalism cases.},

  abstract = {The U.S. Supreme Court rarely overrules its own decisions, overturning fewer than three precedents per term (Brenner and Spaeth, 1995). For the most part, the Court acts instead to preserve the consistency and continuity of the law. However, there are times when the Court formally alters precedent and, in so doing, affirms the decision of a lower court. That is, the Court upholds a lower-court ruling that conflicts with, or even ignores, its past decisions, overruling itself in the process. Such a situation violates two fundamental legal norms. First, as subordinates in the judicial hierarchy, lower-court judges are expected to abide by the decisions of their superior, the Supreme Court, and second, according to the doctrine of stare decisis, the Supreme Court has a duty to follow its own precedents. In this article, we conduct a descriptive analysis of the overruling decisions of the Warren, Burger, and Rehnquist courts that affirmed lower-court rulings. A number of questions are relevant. Under what circumstances do lower courts perceive that a marked deviation from Supreme Court precedent is legally and politically safe? Is there evidence that the lower courts attempt to anticipate the high court's reaction to an alteration in precedent? What role does ideology play in the lower courts' rulings? We address these questions as we examine these unique instances in which lower courts appear to initiate the alteration of Supreme Court precedent.},

Because their measures came from sources independent of the judicial vote, scholars have widely adopted them. This note updates, backdates, and extends the Segal and Cover research by adding the two Bush appointees and the seven Roosevelt and four Truman nominees whose service extended beyond the start of the Vinson Court. While we find that the ideological values of the Eisenhower through Bush appointees correlate strongly with votes cast in economic and civil liberties cases, the results are less robust for justices appointed by Roosevelt and Truman.}

Several political actors have argued that courts have assumed too much power after the democratic transformation process in 1989/1990. These claims are explicitly or implicitly connected to the charge that courts have constrained the room for manoeuvre of the legislatures too heavily and that they have entered the field of politics. Nevertheless, the question to what extent has this aggregation of power constrained the dominant political actors has never been examined accurately and systematically in the literature. The present volume fills this gap by applying an innovative research methodology to quantify the impact and effect of court’s decisions on legislation and legislators, and measure the strength of judicial decisions in six CEE countries.},

It starts with an introduction breaking the question down into two contrasting possibilities. Is judicial decision-making determined purely by law or can we trace the influence of various extralegal factors? In order to answer these questions, the article provides an overview of the current state of the art in international (mainly US) literature and its historical development. Based on an interpretation of the current state of the art, it reaches an intermediate conclusion: that especially in hard cases, there is (practically speaking) considerable space for judicial discretion, and that, as a matter of fact, decisions in these cases are influenced by various extra-legal factors. Given that most of the literature is of US origin, the article further discusses the possibility of “proving” this in Czech conditions. In this regard, the article arrives at a position of moderate methodological skepticism – i.e. that for many reasons, it is hard to do so, even though the aforementioned conclusions should – in principle – be generally applicable.},

Based on a duration analysis of cases decided from the 1946 through 1995 terms, we show that ideological incongruence between a precedent and a subsequent Court increases the chance of it being overruled. Two legal norms also exert substantive effects as the Court is less likely to overrule statutory precedents and more likely to overrule precedents that previously have been interpreted negatively by the Court. While certain precedent characteristics also influence this decision, the political environment exerts no such effect. Consequently, one of the principal implications of this research is that legal norms influence Supreme Court decision making.},

IRT models have several attractive features that make them appealing for test developers and researchers to use to construct educational and psychological tests (Lord, 1980). The models can be applied to educational achievement tests such as TIMSS, as well as to psychological latent variables such as depression or anxiety measures. IRT is the driving force for the development and widespread use of computerized adaptive testing. The purpose of this chapter is to introduce IRT and its fundamental principles and applications so that the reader who is unfamiliar with IRT will have sufficient knowledge to apply the IRT DIF methods described in Chapter 4.},
